### Introduction

Object detection and classification is an integral part of modern-day robotic applications. In this project, we have leveraged NVIDIAâ€™s DIGITS workflow to develop image classification networks on two datasets. We have discussed on the hyperparameter tuning and selection of a deep convolutional neural network architecture. We have analyzed the performance of the models, and finalize the project with our findings and future work. Please refer to [writeup](writeup.pdf) for detail explanation. The model files are available in [model](model) directory.
